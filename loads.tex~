A summary of the project-specific loading criteria follows (see appendix A for a detailed list of load values).

\subsection{Gravity loading}
The gravity loads listed in Table \ref{grav_load} are in addition to the self weight of the structure. The minimum loading requirements were taken from ASCE 7 as well as the loading criteria supplied by the engineer of record. Loads are given in pounds per square foot (psf).

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
      \textbf{Use} & \textbf{Live Loading} & \textbf{Superimposed} \\
      &&\textbf{Dead Loading} \\
      \hlineB{2}
      Parking Garage & 40 & 3 \\
      \hline
      Storage/HVAC & 125 & 28 \\
      \hline
      Stairways, exits & 100 & 28 \\
      \hline
      Level 1 residential & 40 & 28 \\
      \hline
      Level 1 corridors & 100 & 28 \\
      \hline
      Level 1 office, recreational & 100 & 28 \\
      \hline
      Level 1 courtyard (footprint) & 150 & 150 \\
      \hline
      Elevated levels residential & 40 & 28 \\
      \hline
      Elevated levels corridors & 40 & 28 \\

      Cornices & 60 & - \\

      Balconies & 40 & 28 \\

In addition to these uniform slab loads, a perimeter dead load of 12 psf was applied to the structure to account for the weight of the cladding system.

\subsection{Wind design criteria}
Wind loading is in accordance with the IBC and ASCE 7 requirements as shown in Table \ref{wind_load}.
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
Basic Wind Speed, 3-second gust (ultimate) & 115 mph \\
Basic Wind Speed, 3-second gust (nominal) & 90 mph \\
Exposure & B \\
Occupancy Category & II \\
Importance Factor ($I_w$ ) & 1.0 \\
Topographic Factor ($K_{zt}$ ) & 1.0\\
Enclosure Classification & Enclosed \\
Mean Roof Height (h) & 33' \\
  \end{tabular}
