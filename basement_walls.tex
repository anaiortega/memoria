\subsection{Introduction}

The design is bassed in the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Design wall with pinned base and pinned top.
\item Neglect corner regions (wall spans one-way only).
\item Top slab is in place and has achieved full strength prior to backfilling.
\item Vehicular traffic around the building is represented by a uniform load of $250\ psf$ ($11.97\ kN/m^2$).
  \item The vertical response of the soil calculated using a Winkler model with a subgrade reaction module of set of 200 pounds per cubic inch ($54.29 \times 10^6\ N/m^3$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Load determination}

\subsubsection{Axial loads from building}
The loads transferred by the top slab to the wall are as follows:
